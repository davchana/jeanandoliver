On our last full day we decided to explore the wider region. Stopping again in Stowe, we made our way to Montpelier, the state capital, and hiked some urban park trails. From there we headed to Greensboro, a small rural town in the Northeast Kingdom, to sample some renowned local beer at [Hill Farmstead Brewery](http://hillfarmstead.com/main/). It was funny to see that the place was bustling and crowded, considering the lightly-traveled dirt roads weâ€™d taken to find it.
