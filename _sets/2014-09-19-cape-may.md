We arrived in Cape May, NJ at an ideal time of year. In mid-September, most of the summer beach crowds and vacationers had gone home, but the weather – and water – was still warm and inviting. We enjoyed quiet trails through marshes full of migrating [birds](http://www.njaudubon.org/SectionCapeMayBirdObservatory/CMBOHome.aspx) and [butterflies](https://capemaymonarchs.blogspot.com/), and going for barefoot morning runs on the soft sand. We’d missed [horseshoe crab spawning season](https://thesmallermajority.com/2013/05/14/the-greatest-show-on-earth-happening-now/) (May–June), but saw remains of their glistening carapaces along the shore. Sunsets were hard to capture in the dim light, but one night towards the end of our stay the colors were punctuated with the fleeting silhouettes of jumping dolphins.
