Now we had time to focus on some serious hiking! We headed out on Route 108 through Mount Mansfield State Forest and over Smuggler’s Notch. This mountain pass had a dramatically different landscape and cooler climate. Here the trees were nearly all bare save for some aspens, and the road narrowed to a single lane between giant boulders. Parking the car for a moment, we stepped out into strong winds and looked up at a sheer rock face known as Elephant’s Head.

Traveling on, we arrived at the base of Mount Hunger, near the town of Waterbury. The trail was a steep, rocky out-and-back that gave us a challenge (though Sapphie could have done it three times over in the time it took us).
