Between the flu and some bad weather it had been over a month since weâ€™d made it back to Shenandoah, so we were keen for a hike on the first gorgeous Sunday in April. This time we picked a trail just down the road from [Meneka Peak](https://jeanandoliver.space/meneka-peak/), hiking up [Little Crease Mountain](https://www.hikingupward.com/GWNF/LittleCreaseMountain/) to the southeast, across Passage Creek from the Meneka trail.

Driving out from DC, the roadsides were blotched with purple-pink redbuds. Though temperatures ranged in the 60s-70s all day, the hike got hot fast, as the trees on the mountainside had yet to leaf out, exposing us to cloudless blue sky for nearly the entire nine-mile out-and-back.

With some encouragement, [Sapphie](https://jeanandoliver.space/sapphie-adoption/), our sometimes hydrophobic hound dog, learned that a splash in a cool, gurgling mountain stream is a good antidote to hours of walking on glittering white rocks.
