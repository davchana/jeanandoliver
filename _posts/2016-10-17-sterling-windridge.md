The grounds around the cabin were surrounded by leafy walking trails. As “peak fall foliage” was a little late this year, we arrived just in time. The golds shining from maples and aspens were particularly brilliant. We observed downy woodpeckers, nuthatches, and chickadees flitting near the bases of the trees, and Sapphie spotted wild turkeys.
