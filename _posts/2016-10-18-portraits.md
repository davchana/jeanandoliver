We’d planned to meet our justice of the peace and photographer at our cabin, but before they arrived we discovered an even better spot – Sterling Pond, just down the road, next to old farmland and community trails.

We couldn’t have asked for a better day. Intense fall color was made only brighter as sunset light began to hit the mountainside.
