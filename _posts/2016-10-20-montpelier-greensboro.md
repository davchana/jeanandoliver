On our last full day we decided to explore the wider region. Stopping in Stowe, we made our way to Montpelier, the state capital, and hiked some urban park trails. From there we headed to Greensboro, in the Northeast Kingdom, to sample some renowned local beer at Hill Farmstead Brewery. It was funny to see that the place was busy with activity, considering the rural dirt roads we'd taken to find it.
