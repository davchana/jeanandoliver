The cabin grounds also included a little lake with big mountain views. After relaxing by the lake, we headed out to explore Burlington (not pictured). On the way we stopped in Essex Junction to get our marriage license. The waiting area was dog-friendly and the paperwork simple. With license successfully in hand, we drove on to Burlington and took in views of Lake Champlain from the waterfront park, explored the Church Street Marketplace, and stocked up on fresh vegetables at [City Market, Onion River Co-op](https://www.citymarket.coop).
