After a 10+ hour drive – and plenty of sighs from our hound dog, Sapphie – we arrived at our cabin at the [Sterling Ridge](http://sterlingridgeresort.com/) resort in Jeffersonville, Vermont on October 16. The first thing we did was make a fire in the wood stove and dinner in the cabin’s fully equipped kitchen. The morning began with tea on the porch, and then we were off to explore the walking trails nearby.

Every day of our trip, we made fresh food from local shops and co-ops, having bread or making pancakes for breakfast and roasted and seasoned vegetables for dinner.
